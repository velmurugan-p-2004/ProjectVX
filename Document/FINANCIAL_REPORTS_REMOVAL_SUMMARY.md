## üìã **Changes Made**

### **1. HTML Template Updates**
**File**: `templates/admin_reports.html`

**Removed Section** (Lines 472-516):
- Complete "Financial & Analytics Reports" category section
- Cost Analysis report card with `generateReport('cost_analysis')` button
- Trend Analysis report card with `generateReport('trend_analysis')` button  
- Executive Summary report card with `generateReport('executive_summary')` button

**Result**: Clean removal without affecting layout or other report categories

### **2. JavaScript Cleanup**
**File**: `static/js/salary_management.js`

**Removed Report Names** (Lines 1318-1320):
```javascript
// REMOVED:
'cost_analysis': 'Cost Analysis Report',
'trend_analysis': 'Trend Analysis Report', 
'executive_summary': 'Executive Summary Report'
```

**Result**: JavaScript `generateReport()` function no longer recognizes these report types

### **3. Backend Route Handler Cleanup**
**File**: `app.py`

**Removed Route Handlers** (Lines 1247-1252):
```python
# REMOVED:
elif report_type == 'cost_analysis':
    return generate_cost_analysis_report(school_id, year, format_type)
elif report_type == 'trend_analysis':
    return generate_trend_analysis_report(school_id, year, format_type)
elif report_type == 'executive_summary':
    return generate_executive_summary_report(school_id, year, format_type)
```

**Removed Function Definitions** (Lines 1497-1510):
```python
# REMOVED:
def generate_cost_analysis_report(school_id, year, format_type):
def generate_trend_analysis_report(school_id, year, format_type):
def generate_executive_summary_report(school_id, year, format_type):
```

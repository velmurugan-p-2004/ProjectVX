# Daily Attendance Report Excel Export Fix - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: The Daily Attendance Report Excel export appeared to only contain summary statistics, missing the individual staff data columns that users expected to see.

**Root Cause**: The individual staff data **was actually present** in the Excel file, but it was located in the "Daily Records" sheet, which was the **third sheet** in the workbook. Users only saw the "Summary" sheet (which opened by default) and didn't realize there was additional detailed data on other sheets.

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Reordered Excel Sheets**
Changed the sheet creation order in the `generate_daily_attendance_report()` function in `app.py`:

**Before (Issue):**
1. Summary (first/active sheet) ‚Üê Users saw this only
2. Department Summary  
3. Daily Records ‚Üê Individual staff data was here but hidden

**After (Fixed):**
1. **Daily Records (first/active sheet)** ‚Üê Users now see individual staff data immediately
2. Summary 
3. Department Summary

### 2. **Enhanced Daily Records Sheet**
- Added clear title: "Daily Attendance Report - Individual Staff Records"
- Improved formatting with proper headers starting from row 3
- Data starts from row 4 for better organization
- Proper column widths for readability

### 3. **All Required Columns Present**
The "Daily Records" sheet includes all requested individual staff columns:
- ‚úÖ Staff ID
- ‚úÖ Staff Name (Full Name)  
- ‚úÖ Department
- ‚úÖ Position
- ‚úÖ Time In (Check In Time)
- ‚úÖ Time Out (Check Out Time)
- ‚úÖ Status
- ‚úÖ Additional useful columns: Late (min), Early Dep (min), Work Hrs, OT Hrs

## Technical Changes Made

**File Modified**: `d:\VISHNRX\staffongoingmohannew-updation\app.py`
**Function**: `generate_daily_attendance_report()` (lines ~3418-3475)

**Key Changes**:
1. Create "Daily Records" sheet first as the active sheet
2. Added descriptive title with merge cells for better presentation
3. Headers now start at row 3 with data starting at row 4
4. Maintained all three sheets but reordered for better user experience

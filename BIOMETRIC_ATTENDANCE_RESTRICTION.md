# Biometric Attendance Restriction - Once Per Day Implementation

## Overview
The system has been successfully updated to restrict biometric attendance updates to only **once per day** per staff member for both check-in and check-out operations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Validation Rules (`validate_verification_rules` function)
- **Check-in validation**: Prevents multiple check-ins on the same date
- **Check-out validation**: Prevents multiple check-outs on the same date
- **Dependency validation**: Ensures check-in happens before check-out

### 2. Backend Routes Updated

#### `/check_device_verification` Route
- Enforces validation rules before processing attendance
- Blocks duplicate check-ins/check-outs with appropriate error messages
- Only allows legitimate attendance updates

#### `/sync_biometric_attendance` Route
- Respects existing attendance records
- Only updates if no previous time_in/time_out exists
- Prevents sync operations from bypassing the restriction

### 3. Error Messages
When staff attempt multiple updates, they receive clear messages:
- **Multiple check-ins**: "You have already checked in today. Multiple check-ins are not allowed."
- **Multiple check-outs**: "You have already checked out today. Multiple check-outs are not allowed."
- **Missing check-in**: "You must check in first before checking out."

### 4. Database Protection
The system validates against the `attendance` table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM attendance WHERE staff_id = ? AND date = ?
```
This ensures no duplicate time records can be created for the same date.

## Business Logic Flow

### Check-in Process
1. Staff uses biometric device
2. System checks for existing check-in for today
3. If exists: **BLOCKED** with error message
4. If not exists: **ALLOWED** and recorded

### Check-out Process
1. Staff uses biometric device  
2. System checks for existing check-out for today
3. If exists: **BLOCKED** with error message
4. If check-in missing: **BLOCKED** with error message
5. If valid: **ALLOWED** and recorded

## User Experience

### Staff Dashboard
- Shows current attendance status
- Displays appropriate messages when attendance is already marked
- Prevents confusion about multiple updates

### Admin Dashboard
- Sync operations respect the restriction
- No manual override to bypass the restriction
- Maintains data integrity

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **`app.py`**: Updated validation and attendance processing logic
2. **Backend validation**: `validate_verification_rules()` function
3. **Sync logic**: Enhanced to respect existing records

### Database Queries
- All attendance operations check for existing records first
- Uses date-based filtering to enforce daily restriction
- Maintains referential integrity

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents duplicate or conflicting attendance records
2. **Business Rule Compliance**: Enforces one attendance update per day policy
3. **User Clarity**: Clear error messages when restrictions apply
4. **System Reliability**: Consistent behavior across all entry points

## Testing Verification

The system has been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Multiple check-ins are blocked
- ✅ Multiple check-outs are blocked  
- ✅ Check-out without check-in is blocked
- ✅ Valid single updates are allowed
- ✅ Sync operations respect restrictions
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Staff can now only update their biometric attendance **once per day** for each type (check-in/check-out), ensuring data accuracy and business rule compliance.

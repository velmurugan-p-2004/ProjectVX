# Fix: Recent Biometric Verifications - Duplicate Entries Resolved

## Problem
The "Recent Biometric Verifications" section was showing multiple entries for check-in and check-out times on the same day, causing confusion and cluttered display.

## Root Cause
The system was inserting a biometric verification record for EVERY successful check-in or check-out through the `check_device_verification` route. This meant that if a user verified their attendance multiple times (even though the actual attendance was properly restricted to once per day), the verification history would show all attempts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified SQL Query
Changed the query to show only the **latest verification per day per type** (check-in/check-out):

```sql
-- Before (showing all verifications)
SELECT verification_type, verification_time, biometric_method, verification_status
FROM biometric_verifications
WHERE staff_id = ?
ORDER BY verification_time DESC
LIMIT 10

-- After (showing latest per day per type)
SELECT verification_type, verification_time, biometric_method, verification_status
FROM biometric_verifications bv1
WHERE staff_id = ?
  AND verification_time = (
    SELECT MAX(verification_time)
    FROM biometric_verifications bv2
    WHERE bv2.staff_id = bv1.staff_id
      AND bv2.verification_type = bv1.verification_type
      AND DATE(bv2.verification_time) = DATE(bv1.verification_time)
  )
ORDER BY verification_time DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### 2. Enhanced UI Display
- Added visual icons for check-in (ðŸŸ¢) and check-out (ðŸ”µ)
- Different colored badges for different verification types
- Updated subtitle to clarify "Latest check-in and check-out times (one per day)"

### 3. Files Modified
1. **`app.py`** (lines 3368-3376 and 4493-4501): Updated queries for both staff profile views
2. **`templates/staff_my_profile.html`**: Enhanced display with icons and better badges
3. **`templates/staff_profile.html`**: Enhanced admin view with icons and better badges

## Result
- **Before**: Multiple entries per day showing every verification attempt
- **After**: Clean display showing only the latest check-in and check-out for each day
- **Benefit**: Clear, uncluttered view that matches the business logic of "once per day" attendance

## Technical Details

### Query Logic
The new query uses a correlated subquery to find the maximum verification time for each combination of:
- Staff ID
- Verification type (check-in/check-out) 
- Date

This ensures only the latest verification of each type per day is shown.

### UI Improvements
- Check-in: Green badge with right arrow icon
- Check-out: Blue badge with left arrow icon  
- Success status: Green "Success" badge
- Failed status: Red "Failed" badge

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and the query has been tested to ensure:
- âœ… No SQL errors
- âœ… Proper filtering of duplicate entries
- âœ… Maintains chronological order
- âœ… Enhanced visual clarity

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
Staff will now see a clean, organized view of their biometric verifications with only the relevant check-in and check-out times displayed once per day.
